Hello there!!!

I'm Wilton, an engineer from Brazil. I have 20+ years of professional experience in technology, where I've worked for all sorts of companies, including Hewlett Packard, BV Bank, Vivo, Embraer, UOL, Bionexo, and so on. I worked in various roles such as DevOps and Cloud Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, and SysAdmin.

I also worked for leading teams, being one of the functions performed as a Tech Lead SRE and another as a Cloud Foundation team coordinator.

Actually. I'm studying topics like Kubernetes, Cloud, Terraform, DevOps, Python, and Golang.

In my personal life, I'm married for almost 14 years with two children. I like playing video games, walking, riding a bike, watching series on any streaming platform, or doing nothing.

You can find me on the social networks below.
