Hello there!!!

I'm Wilton, an engineer from Brazil. I have 20+ years of professional experience in technology, where Iâ€™ve worked in all sorts of companies, including Hewlett Packard, BV Bank, Vivo, Embraer, UOL, Bionexo and so on. I worked in various roles such as Devops and Cloud Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer and, SysAdmin.

I also worked leading teams, being one of the functions performed as a Tech Lead SRE and another as coordinator of a Cloud Foundation team.

Actually, I'm spending time studying topics like Kubernetes, Cloud, Terraform, DevOps, Python and Golang.

In my personal life, I'm married for almost 14 years with 2 children. I like to play videos games, walking, riding bike, watch series on any streaming platform or simply do nothing.
